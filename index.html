    <h1>The Profit: 3 Best Episodes, Ranked</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 episodes of the entire show on CNBC.</h2>
    <p>The Profit is an American documentary-style reality television show broadcast on CNBC. In each episode, Marcus Lemonis typically offers a capital investment and his expertise to struggling small businesses in exchange for an ownership stake in the company, but a series of "Inside Look" episodes have commentary by Lemonis and executive producer Amber Mazzola as they watch past episodes. Some episodes simply show a business, city, or industry without any investment by Lemonis.

        This website showcases 3 episodes of the show using basic HTML. No CSS, no... well... anything. Just me and my granite.
